         /*The use of transitions allows for delay of change through the .delay() function. Like the .duration() function, .delay() is set 
         with the wait in milliseconds before implementing the change. 

         Delays can also draw attention to visual elements when they first appear. By making the elements pulse when they arrive onscreen,
         you let users know that these are dynamic objects and tempt users to click or otherwise interact with them. Delays, like duration, 
         can be dynamically set based on the bound data for each element. 
         
         Transition chaining sets multiple transitions one after another, and each is activated after the last transition has finished.
         Approach is used to cause the individual circles to grow to an exaggerated size and then shrinl to their final size in the order
         in which they appear in the bound dataset. 

         The statements causes a pulse because they uses transition chaining to set one transition, followed by a second after the 
         completion of the first. Begin by drawing the circles with a radius of 0, so they’re invisible. Each element has a delay set 
         to its array position i times 0.1 seconds (100 ms), after which the transition causes the circle to grow to a radius of 40 px. 
         After each circle grows to that size, a second transition shrinks the circles to 20 px. 
         The effect causes the circles to pulse sequentially. */

        To add images to visualization, select the <g> elements that have the team data already bound to them, and add an SVG image. 

        To make the images show up successfully, use insert() instead of append() because that provides capacity to tell D3 to insert 
        the images before the text elements. This keeps the labels from being drawn behind the newly added images. 
        
        Because each image name is the same as the team name of each data point, can use an inline function to point to that value, 
        combined with strings for the directory and file extension. Also need to define the height and width of the images because 
        SVG images, by default, have no setting for height and width and won’t display until these are set. Also need to manually 
        center SVG images.  The x and y attributes are set to a negative value of one-half the respective height and width, which 
        centers the images in their respective circles.
